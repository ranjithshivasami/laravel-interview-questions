   **Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** is one of the main features of the Laravel framework. It may be defined as an advanced PHP implementation of the active record pattern.

    *Active record pattern is an architectural pattern which is found in software. It is responsible for keeping in-memory object data in relational databases*

    Eloquent ORM is also responsible for providing the internal methods at the same time when enforcing constraints on the relationship between database objects. Eloquent ORM represents database tables as classes, with their object instances tied to single table rows, while following the active record pattern.
